# F28WP
Web Programming Coursework for 2nd Year Computer Science/Software Engineering

# Best Boy Tank

A top down 'Tanks' inspired game where the goal is to destroy other users tanks in a MMOG setting. The game will mainly be developed in Javascript,
but also use potential technologies such as Socket.IO to maintain server connections and MySQL to manage database storage. The development team currently consists of
Callum Taylor, Jacob Mowat, Iskander Mufazalov, Michael Soutar and Haydn McGrath.

# Coursework Details
A develop an online multiplayer game that that lets players interact and play other people in realtime. Store and view information (e.g., high-scores, number of online active players). Play other
people or join other games. On interaction should be communicated to a web server and recorded in
server side storage (e.g. MongoDB, MySQL or files), as well as being displayed back to the user side
(e.g., leaderboards, other player interaction). The front-end should also let a user list all or some
game information that is available (e.g., playerâ€™s past scores and other where they sit in the global
high scores).

The following Web technologies should be used
- HTML 5 (XHTML syntax), CSS 3, DOM 1+ and JavaScript
- Client and server side technologies and Database (or server storage system)


# Objectives
- Design and implementation web-based 'multiplayer' game
- Theory and practice of server-side scripting and database for web games
- Code modulation in JavaScript
- Techniques to implement best practices in web development such as Test-Driven -
Development, Version Control and JavaScript documentation API
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and testing

# Development Enviroment
Access to a web server for online publication, access to a software version control system (GIT),
access to a limited range of web services (e.g. a high-score service, game-state management
services)

# Goals
