# :trophy: Best Boy Tank :trophy:

Best Boy Tank is an IO style tank game developed by Callum Taylor, Haydn McGrath, Iskander Mufazalov
, Michael Soutar and Jacob Mowat. The game uses technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS and MySQL and libraries
such as webpack for parsing and uuid for unique identification. The server infrastructure consists of node.js
, express.js and also socket.io to manage websockets.

# Coursework Details
A develop an online multiplayer game that that lets players interact and play other people in realtime. Store and view information (e.g., high-scores, number of online active players). Play other
people or join other games. On interaction should be communicated to a web server and recorded in
server side storage (e.g. MongoDB, MySQL or files), as well as being displayed back to the user side
(e.g., leaderboards, other player interaction). The front-end should also let a user list all or some
game information that is available (e.g., playerâ€™s past scores and other where they sit in the global
high scores).

The following Web technologies should be used
- HTML 5 (XHTML syntax), CSS 3, DOM 1+ and JavaScript
- Client and server side technologies and Database (or server storage system)


# Objectives
- Design and implementation web-based 'multiplayer' game
- Theory and practice of server-side scripting and database for web games
- Code modulation in JavaScript
- Techniques to implement best practices in web development such as Test-Driven -
Development, Version Control and JavaScript documentation API
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and testing

# Development Enviroment
Access to a web server for online publication, access to a software version control system (GIT),
access to a limited range of web services (e.g. a high-score service, game-state management
services)

# Requirements
- Github
  + show contributions weekly (commits, tasks, bug fixes, etc)
  + insights:
	- contributors
	- commits
	- code frequency
	- dependacies
- avoid libraries
- use testing
- complex implementation
- HTML5/CSS/Javascript complient
- Animated and dynamic

# :man_scientist: Server Instructions :man_scientist:

- navigate to root directory
- install all dependencies with 'npm install'
- once installed, run server with 'npm run start'
- once compiled, in your browser, type localhost:3000
- alternatively we have a live page url where multiplayer can be seen visually
